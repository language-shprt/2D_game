The player controls the Bee that can fly in all directions. Each level starts with a random word of a certain length. Each letter appears on the screen randomly in a special holder.

At the beginning of each level the player is given some time to memorize their position. Then the letters disappear, and the Bee can fly freely.

The player should collect the word by touching empty holders in the correct order. There are also Dandelion Seeds falling down from the sky which the Bee needs to avoid. Their number and speed increases when the next level starts.

At the end of the game the names and the results of the best players appear on the screen.
